            <p>Hi everybody ðŸ˜‰. I am Shamil Mammadov. I am 18 yo. I live in Azerbaijan in Sumgait. I was born in
                28.06.2007 in Sumgait. I finished the first year of university and am moving on to my second year.</p>
            <p>Let's talk about my character. I am a cheerful, positive, happy and a little shy person. I love the
                truth, I am straightforward, a little soft and attentive.</p>

            <h2>My hobbies:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Chess:
                    <p class="addition">I began playing chess professionally at the age of 5. I took many first, second,
                        and third places, and I have lots of diplomas, medals, and also a couple of trophies. But
                        unfortunately, after moving to 9th grade and the start of school workload, I had to partially
                        quit chess. The same happened in 10th grade. But in 11th grade, I was forced to leave chess
                        completely. Now, after 11 years in chess, I no longer play professionally, and alas, the
                        interest I once had is gone. But I donâ€™t regret spending so much of my time on it!</p>
                    <p class="addition">Thanks to chess, I visited many cities and countries, met a huge number of
                        people, and gained lots of emotions and memories. But itâ€™s not all sadâ€”sometimes I still log in
                        and play online chess.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Listening music:
                    <p class="addition">I love to listen to music while I am studying, while I am on the road, while I
                        am doing housework, when I want to relax.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Watching something:
                    <p class="addition">In my free time I love to watch anime, films, series, doramas, multfilms.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Talking/Chatting with friedns:
                    <p class="addition">Also in my free time, I love hanging out with friends - we chat about
                        everything, laugh, have fun, fool around, and do whatever comes to mind.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Playing games:
                    <p class="addition">In the past, I used to love playing games a lot. It was impossible to tear me
                        away from them. But as I grew older, I began to understand more and more that spending all my
                        time on games wasnâ€™t worth it. You need to do other things, too. Nowadays, I only play games
                        occasionallyâ€”with friends, comrades, and my brother.</p>
